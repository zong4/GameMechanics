## 🕒 SuperHot Recreation

A Unity recreation of **SuperHot’s** core experience — where **time only moves when you move**.  
Rebuilt from scratch to replicate its **time manipulation** and **combat replay** mechanics, delivering the signature “time as a weapon” tactical shooter experience.

![Demo](./Assets/SuperHot.gif)

### 🧩 Core Features
- Time-based motion control
- Bullet-time combat system
- Replay system capturing player motion

### 🛠️ Upcoming Plans
- [ ] 2–4 player online mode with synchronized time flow  
- [ ] Cooperative and competitive tactical missions  

---

## 💣 Bomber

A physics-based platformer where you **are the bomb** — using explosive recoil to **jump**, **double-jump**, and **propel** yourself through the level.

![](./Assets/Bomber.gif)

### 🧩 Core Features
- Explosion-driven movement system
- Diagonal jump and aerial control mechanics

### 🛠️ Upcoming Plans
- [ ] Destructible environment and obstacle interaction  
- [ ] Advanced recoil chaining for combo movement

## 🕒 SuperHot – *Time Moves When You Move*

![SuperHot Demo](./Assets/SuperHot.gif)

A faithful recreation of **SuperHot’s** signature time manipulation gameplay.  
Here, movement equals time — the world freezes until the player acts. Every motion, every bullet, every dodge becomes a deliberate tactical choice.

**Highlights**
- Dynamic “bullet-time” simulation  
- Replay system that captures player motion for cinematic playback  
- Built entirely in Unity using custom motion and time control logic  

**In Progress**
- Multiplayer mode with synchronized time flow  
- Cooperative missions and competitive tactical battles

## 💣 Bomber – *Be the Explosion*

![Bomber Demo](./Assets/Bomber.gif)

In this prototype, the player **is the bomb** — using controlled explosions as propulsion.  
Each detonation is both a weapon and a movement mechanic, creating a rhythm-based, physics-driven platformer.

**Highlights**
- Explosion recoil as a movement system  
- Diagonal leap and double-jump mechanics  
- Physics-based traversal design  

**In Progress**
- Environmental destruction  
- Chain-reaction puzzles and level design

## 🌍 Minecraft Recreation – *Procedural Worlds, Reimagined*

![Minecraft Demo](./Assets/MC.png)

A deep dive into **procedural generation** inspired by Minecraft’s terrain system.  
This project rebuilds the world generation pipeline from the ground up using **Perlin Noise**, optimized for real-time performance and modularity.

**Highlights**
- 2D & 3D Perlin noise terrain generation  
- Real-time mesh construction  
- Chunk streaming and dynamic loading  

**In Progress**
- Multi-threaded terrain generation  
- Custom block data and material properties
