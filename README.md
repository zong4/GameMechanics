# Game Mechanics Showcase:

## SuperHot

A Unity recreation of **SuperHot’s** core concept — where *time only moves when you move*. Rebuilt with focus on time manipulation and cinematic combat replay to capture the original’s “time as a weapon” experience.

### Upcoming Plans

- [ ] 2–4 player online support with synchronized time flow.
- [ ] Cooperative missions and competitive tactical modes.

## Bomber

A physics-based platformer where you **are** the bomb — using explosive recoil to jump, double-jump, and blast through obstacles. Inspired by **Öoom**.

### Upcoming Plans

- [ ] Explosive obstacle destruction mechanics.
- [ ] Expanded level design with chain-reaction puzzles.

## Minecraft

A reimagining of **Minecraft’s** procedural world generation, powered by **Perlin Noise**. Faithfully reproduces its chunk-based terrain system while optimizing generation logic for performance.

### Upcoming Plans

- [ ] Parallelized terrain generation.
- [ ] Chunk-based loading and streaming.
- [ ] Implementation of specific block types and properties.
